Theros has a unique metaphysical property: things believed and dreamed here eventually become true.[3] The collective unconscious of millions of people has the literal power of creation, though the process unfolds over countless centuries. Thus the gods of Theros and their servants were believed, dreamed of, and narrated into existence, materializing, and becoming fully real as a result of mortal belief in their power.

Two closely related concepts loom large in the way mortals think about their place in the world: fate and destiny.[3] Fate is that which you cannot change, it is spun out in a tapestry woven by a trio of semi-divine women, The Fates. Destiny is that which you’re meant to do. While fate is what happens when you don’t take responsibility for your life, destiny is what happens when you commit to growing, learning, and taking chances. Being “destined for greatness” only comes through active and conscious decisions. But fate is what happens when you let other people and external circumstances dictate your life. The strands of destiny are spun from the hair of the ancient god Klothys.

More than just for their deeds, heroes fill an important role among the inhabitants of Theros.[3] Legendary heroes form a vast collection of archetypes (the Hunter, the General, the Philosopher, etc.) who embody the qualities to strive for and the potential of mortals to be more than mere drops in the raging river of fate
