| Description: This sticky, adhesive fluid, ignites when exposed to  air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alkahest’s flame as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 3d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 15 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.|
